 This is not going to sound like very ladylike. And what my mother did was she took me by the hand. She took me down to the person who had come up with this idea of having a petition, and she walked right in and into the kitchen, and she said to him, what what  made you decide that you should have us not living in this neighborhood? Who were you to make that decision? So part of it, I learned very quickly that if you've got an issue, you better start speaking up very early on it. What was nice about the end of it was the the uh principal at the school called all of the people together and told them that if they tried to get us out of the uh the neighborhood, he would make sure that we could go into his house and we could still stay there.

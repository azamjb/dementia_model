 Nothing out of the ordinary actors uh get hired and fired every day of the week. uh When it came time for me to go on the Walton interview, it it hadn't been named. All we knew was that the it was a series, a one hour series, and uh and it was about some place in the south. It uh didn't give us too much information. When it came time to go in and meet the producer, I shook hands and uh he just sat there and looked at me for a while. And then finally he said, you wear a rug, which means translated out of Hollywood, you wear a a toupee. And I said, I don't wear a toupee. It It's real stuff and thing in there. So we sat for another couple of minutes and no one said anything and they said, thank you very much for coming in. And of course that's the kiss of death. When someone tells you, thanks for coming in. Two weeks later I got a phone call from my agent and he said they wanted to go to the series. You could have knocked me over. I was I was really surprised.

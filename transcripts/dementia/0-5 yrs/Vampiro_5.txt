 I I kind of grew up in Toronto and and before I left to to to Mexico City to become a professional wrestler, I was always uh dreaming and hoping and uh looking at the stars, trying to figure out one day what was going to become of my life. And then now to be here today in the position that I'm in and to to be representing these companies uh and and I remember being a street kid here in Toronto and now having a television show that's on the L-Ray network that's on Netflix um to be involved in that kind of stuff. It's  It's a little bit overwhelming but it's kind of neat.

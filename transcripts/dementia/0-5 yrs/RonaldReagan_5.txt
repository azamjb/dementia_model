 of us had that uh that same feeling. And uh I think that what Duke felt was what I felt at the time and that is the great immorality of the Vietnam War was for our government to be asking young men to give up their lives in that war when the government had no intention of winning it because they were afraid of what might follow that might be worse if uh we tried to win that particular war. And uh as I say, I think that was the great immorality. I think Duke felt the same. When he made a green berets, there was something more going on in Hollywood at that time than just whether people weren't in favor of the war. I remember that uh we'd call the theater when the picture first opened, it opened to uh reserve seats like a play would be. And Nancy and I couldn't get tickets to it. And we'd call the box office and say, has anyone turned in their tickets or anything that we could and we couldn't? And uh finally, uh we called someone else that was supposed to be in charge of the tickets and found out that uh there were tickets for any night you wanted them. But uh you were being told that the box office that there weren't any tickets available. In other words, the people who were supposed to be promoting the attendance of that picture, were literally keeping people away.

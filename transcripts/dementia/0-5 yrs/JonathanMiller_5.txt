 find yourself in love, loving people. uh And again, as Vikram Shnimes said, it's something which you can, as it were, undertake to encourage yourself to do. It It's very interesting that we use this verb which is usually associated with accidents. I fell in love. It's an involuntary thing that befalls you. It's often, maybe very agonizing, but it's often very joyful. And sometimes it can continue throughout one's life. As it has to that woman has just walked out of the room uh and to to my children. um And those are the only people I've ever loved. So it's a fairly narrow group of people that I love. There are people I like, but the the people I love and wish nothing but good for them. uh Really limited to my family. I have no idea what it is. I don't know why it is that when they are in your house and are born from uh you, that you do, as it were, fall in love with them. Uh why should that, their origin, guarantee uh their their beloved quality?

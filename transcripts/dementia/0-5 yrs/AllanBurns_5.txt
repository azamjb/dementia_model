 Chris Hayward, who was really one of J's top writers, and and uh who had another partner at the time, and and Chris created Dudley-Due Wright, and uh he wrote a lot of the Rocky and Bowling-Cole episodes, and was you know generally a pretty hilarious guy. He and I decided that we really didn't want to stay in the animation business forever. I didn't want to be uh writing for a move when I was 45 years old, and uh and Chris, who was 10 years older than I, sure didn't want to do it anymore. So we began trying um trying our hand at freelance stuff, uh and why we were still working for J. And we came up with an idea to do a series about a family of sort of weird offbeat characters that were loosely based in our minds on the Charles Adams cartoons, and it used to be in the New York, or the very strange looking husband and wife, and look like Peter Laurie and and uh the Empire uh. We thought that would make an interesting kind of family comedy.

I remember when the first logeys I ever went to, it was um at the Palais. Can you believe that? On the floor. And they only had little thin ropes to separate people and that was it. And um I remember Tony Le Mans got a uh logeys and she went past the table. I was only new in the country and as she went past I said, I'm going to get one of those I said.

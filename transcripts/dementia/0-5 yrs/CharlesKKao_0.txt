 I I started the work in industry in 1957 and uh joined the research lab in 1970. By the time I get really into the fiber work, it was already in 1963. Uh the Prior to my fiber work, I was working on microwave systems. First of all, on the six gigahertz uh uh point to point microwave link, it's pure development work of a product. And then uh when I went to STR, that's a research lab. I decided that that's a very wonderful time to joining the uh sort of new generations of wide-band transmission medium. That was uh first of all the circular microwave waveguide. So I was working at at the starting point of 1960 on circular waveguide and it's related activity.

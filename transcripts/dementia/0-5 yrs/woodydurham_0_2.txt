 It was not on my radar or anything. Homer Rice was the athletic director then, and Homer called me one day in Greensboro and said, what do you have about driving down tomorrow and have lunch with me? I'd like to talk to you about our games. And to be a nice guy, I said, yeah, I'd like to do that. So I did, and it was really interesting, because the next day when I walked into his office, and I have a pretty good idea, Susan Strobel, who was the administrative assistant to the athletic director for a number of years, first Chuck Erickson, then Coach Rab, and then uh uh finally Homer Rice, and she also worked for John Swapardson before she retired. And I'd known Susan, and Susan knew I went to school at Carolina. And I think she probably told Homer why didn't he give me a call. And so when I walked in the office, and he got up to shake my hand and welcomed me, he said uh, I found out something interesting about you yesterday, and I said, really what's that? He said, I found out you went to school here. And I laughed, and I said, well, Homer, if I've been doing ACC basketball with Jim Thacker and Bones McKenney for four years on ACC television, and you didn't know it all yesterday, that I went to school here, and I've been doing a heck of a job, staying neutral. And we had a good laugh on it. But then I got interested in it, and decided I'd try to get it. And Bill Dooley was a football coach in, and Coach Smith was a basketball coach, and he had been named head coach while I was in school in the summer of 1961. And I called him both, and I said, if I try to go for this, would you give me your support? And they both said they would, and they did. And so that's how it all got started.

 Emphatically, yes, yes. I don't see why there's any reason uh for him to be discontented in any way with uh what he's already produced, human beings as they are. But to be as it were thinking, now we can get on with the real uh business of converting them to some religion or punishing them for not fine. The whole idea of this being uh uh thinking, well, the whole point of creating a universe is, in the case of Isla Islam, to have the satisfaction of torturing some of its members forever. But then, as I say, I have no respect for Islam as a system of thought, whereas uh Christianity had uh two things, a first-rate philosophical intellect, instant Paul, knowing all the relevant languages and all the things about the ancient world and the ancient civilization, and the defining instance of a charismatic figure in Jesus Christ.

 Sorry that so many people are hurt. My little grandchild goes to a Catholic nursery, and they were passing around uh candy, everybody. When they got to her, they said, we don't give candy to racists. Seven and nine. So it hurts me. I hurt my ex-wife. She is a beautiful person. She goes to the hospital and she's a bone here at Cedar Sinai. When I went to law school, she worked at the children's hospital. She's a giver. She works at the stage in her life. She's to works. She didn't need this. Her whole life blew up.

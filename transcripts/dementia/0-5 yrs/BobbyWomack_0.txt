 is that you have to love what you do. And for anything else, it's because this business is a cold business. It will take you out and it will break your heart. And most artists get taken advantage of when they're real young and naive. So I know through me loving the business so much, it never was a thrill that I would say, I just want to be left alone, I want to get out. And as long as I can sing, I can deal with it. So put the music first and not the materialistic things that you can buy from it. Or you'll be chasing that rainbow.

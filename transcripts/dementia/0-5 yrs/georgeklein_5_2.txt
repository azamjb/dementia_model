He said, we think it's like Calipso, a mom boat, tango, it's got fads, it's gonna go away. So he let me go and that very night I ran into Elvis. And Elvis said, why won't you on the radio the day?

A lot of you, I said, what am I doing? He said, you're working for me. I said, what are we going to go? We said, what went to Canada, all across America's first big North American tour. uh  We went into Hollywood, make a movie, Jill Haas Rock. Did a Christmas album, I was with him on that.

And I started building my audience and my popularity back up. And did a pretty good, we got the Army. He wanted to work with him again. And I said, I got a TV show now. I said, I'm hot and once again, I just can't go on the road. And Elvis said, he said, what's okay? He got a cart blotch. Anytime you want to go on the road with me, just call him, jump on Lee Samaritan, you know, fly with us, I said.

 do it. And at that time, in 1967, those British people well reasonably well informed about Canada and some were, and those Americans who were the same. And I'm talking to them about people who had no bad feelings, no hostile feelings toward Canada, took for granted that Canada would disappear from the map within a few years. The guessing was that Canada, which would have gone halfway toward becoming a country, we were still a colony, it's often forgotten after the Confederation, we were still a colony. uh the but But we would go all the way to being independent and uh become a country and then realize that it did make no sense because all the power, all all the wealth, all the population was in the United States. And all the lines, natural lines of geography and communication, transportation, finance and so on, went north south. And they wanted us. They wanted us, of course they did, they wanted, it was manifest, they wanted us to stretch up to the pole. And uh two things stopped them. One was the very curious hard to understand objectively, cold bloodedly, choice of Canadians not to become Americans. They just didn't want to become Americans. The second one was this guy, John E. McDonald. By some fluke, we were very lucky. We were a runty little backward provincial colony on the edge of civilization. That's all we were in 1867, but then nothing more. We had in John E. McDonald, what I honestly, and I've looked at things you know with some care, I would put him in the absolute top class of all national leaders in democracies. That is, I would put him up there with Benjamin Disraeli, the British Prime Minister and Abraham Lincoln, of course, the great American president of his time. Best of his time. He was just its uncanny, that's such an able politician. And he was, he was extraordinary, I can tell you, he said, giving examples of his ability to understand what was really going on, then figure out how to manipulate the politician into doing what he thought was necessary. And what he thought was always necessary was to build Canada. Well, you've compared him to other leaders of other democracies. And let's just, let's figure out how much democracy we actually had going on in the country at the time, because remember Canada is a country of three and a half million people at the time. Basically one city. And it's not the city we're in now, it's Montreal, Toronto's 60,000 people. At the time, well, actually only about 20% of people had to vote. No women to start with, uh no native people, no aboriginals to add to that. And then anybody who didn't own property, and you had to own a minimum amount of property, the theory being that those people who had property had a house to protect, whatever farm.

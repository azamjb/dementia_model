I mean, it's silly things like, you know, for instance, um they stopped me from doing the Disney Star Wars weekend. I used to love doing the Disney Star Wars weekends. And it was a it was a lovely lovely job to have every year doing the Disney Star Wars weekend. I wouldn't have been in Florida. And then, uh I mean, that that's one thing which they which they put the block on. And um other things have cropped up which they haven't, you know, or stopped me from doing, you know.

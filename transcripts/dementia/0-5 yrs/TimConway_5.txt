And um Ernie Anderson will be the talent, a a local guy who was uh very funny, at least I thought so. And I would be the director. Now I had never directed and he had very questionable talent. So we went on in the morning. Our first review said, you want to see stink tune into eight o'clock. What a tagline. It stayed on quite some time almost a year because uh or 14 weeks or whatever they were giving us because it was so.

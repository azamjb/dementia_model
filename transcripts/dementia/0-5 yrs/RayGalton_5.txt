 I was standing in our middle of our street watching this doodling bug coming over and I was with a couple of friends. Oh, one way that's going. And then the engine stopped and it immediately did that. And it was diving straight for us. We didn't know what to do. Rushed in all directions. And then to his house, because that was an iris. And then everybody in those days just to keep the key on a piece of string through the letterbox. Put your hands in the letterbox, pull the string out and the key on the end. And we tried to do that in order to get through his house to get to the air-hear shelter. And there was so much squabbling going on with the key in the piece of string. They would have just threw ourselves on the floor and hoped for the best. And like all bombs and things like that, explosions, they always seem much neerer than they are. And I think the buzzbone, when it came down, got caught in the electricity pile on. So I didn't really leave school because when we came up to a leave in, it was bomb damaged. So I didn't go back. And that was it. Never saw me again.

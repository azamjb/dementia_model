 I was standing in in our middle of our street watching this doodling bug coming over and I was with a couple of friends. Oh, one way that's going. And then the engine stopped and it immediately did that. And it was diving straight for us. We didn't know what to do. Rushed in all directions. And then uh to his house, because that was an iris. And then everybody in those days used to keep the key on a piece of string through the letterbox. You know Put your hands in the letterbox, pull the string out and the key on the end. And we tried to do that in order to get through his house to get to the air-hear shelter. And there was so much squabbling going on with the key in the piece of string. They they would have just threw ourselves on the floor and hoped for the best. And like all bombs and things like that, explosions, they they always seem much naerer than they are. And uh I think the buzzbone, when it came down, uh got caught in the uh electricity pile on. you know So I didn't really leave school because uh uh when we came up to a leave in, uh it was bomb damaged. So I I I didn't go back. And that was it. Never saw me again.

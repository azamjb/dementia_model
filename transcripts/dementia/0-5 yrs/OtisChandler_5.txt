 Recently retired after 50 years with Los Angeles Times and the Times Mirror Company. I was publisher for many of those years. I trained in all the departments when I got to the Air Force and worked in every department. I sold advertising and I worked in the press room and all that. And then after I left the Times, I ran the Times Mirror Company which owns other newspapers and media around the country. So that occupied most of my time. That was a great fun too. But the cars were a great balance. I'd get tied up in meetings and then I just tell my secretary, you know, I just got to leave. Tell the people I just can't. So I get my car and go out to a little garage. I had out in El Mane and there were a few cars and porches. And I just to stand there and just kind of look at them and then go back to my next meeting. It was a good, it was a good destressor.

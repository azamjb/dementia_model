 You know, if you've ever gone to a place, a hospice like Casey House, and you see all these wonderful young people, you know, allying in beds, a a lot on the main floor, they're mostly in wheeled chairs, and some walking around it. But they all know their life is coming to an end. It's a terminal. And I would go upstairs, especially at Christmas time, I used to do a program for them every Christmas, and go upstairs. You know, as a mother, it would be do terrible things to me, but I tried to put that aside, and I'd put my armor on somebody who was almost out, you know, and say, did your mother ever sing something you liked, you know, that you really liked it? Maybe I know, and maybe I could sing for you, and they'd say, oh, I don't know, I'd say, well, maybe this one, and I'd sing Sister Mary or something, one of the Christmas things I do. And they'd get the most sort of peaceful look over their face and all of sleep. But I would call back the next day, say, how's George doing today? Oh, we lost George last night. You know, but then you feel that if anything, you'll help them.

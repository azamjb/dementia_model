You know Jim Brown of course, I always felt was best football player that I've ever seen along with Gail Serres. Those those those type of football players are going to make it in today's world. And Aaron Rogers, a a guy like that, he made it in our world. There was no question about that. uh But it's it's nice to get around and to see my friends, I come here to close up in Chicago as I see Dicque all the time. And I played against Mike for so many years there at Green Bay. And he's such a one hell of a guy. I I get to see John Latina, I bring him down to my dinner. I have a dinner every year that we give out to the most versatile college football player, the Paul Harning Award. And I'm And I'm enjoying that dinner every year in February. This year is February 25th. And I bring in good speakers and uh they enjoy it very much. I was trying to get Warren Buffett to come in, be my speaker this year, but he's a little tough to handle as far as traveling. so uh But anyway, we enjoyed that very, very much.

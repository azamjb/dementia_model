We've already set up the special inspector general establishing that piece of responsibility here. And now what we're doing in the context of this bill is putting into effect all the measures that are going to ensure the effectiveness of that special inspector general to make sure that he has the ability to carry out his responsibilities to oversee the way in which this money is being allocated, how it is being used. The impact of its use is none of that was included in that tarp bill, which the previous Secretary of the Treasury came here and in effect forced through the Congress.

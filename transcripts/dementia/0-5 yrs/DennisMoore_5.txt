 about our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and they said they're there for for about to six months and the Department of Defense brings them back for two weeks what they call R&R, a rest of recuperation with their family, then they go back and they finish their their year. The next part of the story I heard I couldn't believe they said the Department of Defense is bringing them back to the East Coast, putting them down a Baltimore land and they're told from here you pay your home way home and by the way be back in two weeks and we get you back to Iraq. I didn't believe it and I had my staff check and it was true. I filed a bill about two weeks later to require the Department of Defense to pay the domestic travel and every time I file a new bill I do what's called a dear colleague letter and within 10 days two weeks I had 138 co-sponsors, Republicans and Democrats signed on this bill. I don't know what to note across the top of my dear colleague letter in blue, and it's a nervous present. I know you care about our troops, please make this happen in this morning. I was stuck in my pocket and we went over to the White House Christmas party and I saw a guy named Don Rumsville and I walked over to him and I said Mr. Secretary of Defense Foreign, talk for a minute. I reached my pocket and he had a newsletter and he said what is this? I told him he said I said i would really appreciate if you could help me get this done for our troops. He said let me see what I can do and get back with you. He never called me back, never wrote me back but two weeks after I talked to him he incorporated my bill into the Defense Department. The Budget Retractor Act is September 1101 just like I'd written and it's now law. That really felt good and I had 2 in fact back home 2 members of the Army come up to me and thank me for doing the bill and they said you know I didn't even come back from Iraq because I knew I didn't have the money to get home. This is before my bill became.

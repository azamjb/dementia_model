 The thing that was shot on Sounder Music was my scene where I am all wet and come into the window to see Maria. And I was supposed to be nervous because I didn't want her to tell on me. And so I was nervous anyway, so it just worked to the benefit of the film. And Julie Anders was so kind to me. And wonderful with the children she would tell us jokes and she made it much easier. In fact, when I watched the new DVD, I watched Julie Anders segment and at the end of her segment, I the tears were rolling down my eyes. I mean it was very nostalgic. The tears are going to roll in my eyes again. Sorry. But it's been a wonderful, wonderful.

 here uh as a contract player at MGM. A comedian named Ted Healy, he looked at me and he said, well, you may have a chance to uh make it in this uh make it in this business. This guy is a strange business out here. But you, uh but always remember one thing. Never treat the audience as customers, always treat the audience as partners. And I've never forgotten it. And it's uh it's meant more to me almost than anything in the the whole uh career that I've I've had in the business.

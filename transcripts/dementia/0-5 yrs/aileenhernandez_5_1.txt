 I arrive at my first political science class. The teacher looks down at me and then he says, if you are not prepared to do all of the work that we're talking about, I would suggest that you leave now and sign up for a home economics. And I look around and for the first time I discover on the only girl in the room. I would not move. Because I knew my mother would not never forgive me if I did. I did very well in college and I saw an ad and I said, would you like a job that doesn't pay a lot of money but gives lots of satisfaction to you in terms of what you're doing in this society? And I said, they're talking to me.

 We are more conscious in this state now about the places where inequity uh actually exists. And we do try to pass laws and we do see some changes. I can remember, for example, when the the issues around disability first came into play. And people said, this is incredible. We can't do all of these things that will cost a fortune for us to do it. And what these things were, what such things is, how do we make sure that people in wheelchairs can get up on a sidewalk and or get into an elevator or do any of those things. And this was horrifying to people who have just got to cost fortunes to you know to carve out all these curves so that you could get people on their on their wheelchairs in there. Well, what has turned out to happen is that by doing that for what was considered a quote, a small group of people, we have incredibly improved the ability of a lot of other people to use them as well. For example, any parent who has a child and a stroller is now using those curved those carved out curves. They would not have been able to do that before, but they found it works. So it didn't just help a small group of people. Once it was done, it opened up a lot of groups of people. I'm sure that any delivery company that has to deliver also appreciates those curves being carved out. And we've also learned that we our stereotypes begin to fall away. Once we have the experience with them, because we have found that we have lost a lot of time.

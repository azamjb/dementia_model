 nine years handed me a clipping, quoting a 1973 statement by a long time friend of a great many of us, Senator Sam J. Irvin Jr., Senator Irvin is now deceased, of course. .ham suggested, well instructed, maybe a better word, that I'll share it with you on an appropriate occasion. And this is it. It was six days before Christmas in 1973. And unless Senator Irvin were to run again in 1974, Senator Irvin's senate career would end on January 3rd, 1975. And it was on that December day that Senator Irvin issued a public statement that the ended speculation as to whether he would or would not seek reelection. Now Senator Irvin did not run again in 1974 and he later explained it this way. And I'm quoting. He said there's one inescapable reality that no man can ignore. And that is that time takes a terrific toll, which is of an increasing nature with those who live many years. And to quote. And then Senator Irvin added, I would hate to be in the Senate and have to, in keeping these words, forced my heart and nerves and send you to serve.

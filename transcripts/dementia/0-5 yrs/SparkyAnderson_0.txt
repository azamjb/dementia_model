 Let the Phillips, before I ever started, Manchin told me, just remember you are gonna deal with many different people, don't want them. They're all different, they all need different things. But my wife above everybody, and you know her, well Carol, I always dependent on her. I would call her every night after a ball game on the road. And if I had had something happen that night, and I was angry, and I was gonna let cat. You're gonna attack me. She said, all I want you to do is go over it and over it tonight and tomorrow, before you get to the park. And I promised you you will make the right decision. And she was always right, because she said, you know something? Never ask someone to be someone they're not. And that's, and you know, that really is all to me, a manager.

 When working class lads didn't have aspirations to become a meteorologist, if I tell my daddy who would have said something warm and supportive like, away in Balyahidya, Big Jesse, I was called up for national service and it just so happened that that week they weren't looking for cooks or empty drivers, they were looking for meteorologists and I'd studied there, vaguely scientific subjects at university. So they said, you man, don't do the balloon shit there, see the metal, so for two years I was an airman meteorologist.

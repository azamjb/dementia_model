 Well, it's the art of intimate singing. It was invented by two people, Gene Oestin, who made a record called My Blue Heaven and made everybody run to a record shop. He was the first guy who made everybody who said, I want to buy that record. I want to buy a phonograph player. He was the first one. He was forgotten, but he shouldn't have been because he really was the first one that made a very big sensation. He made everybody open up record shops that he was the inventor of it, really. He had the reason for it. He and Rico Coruso are, say, a Victor. But then Bing Crosby was the first singer who created the art of intimate singing using a microphone. Before that, all the entertainers and opera singers sang without a microphone. And he was the first one to actually get a microphone and kind of whisper intimately into the microphone. And he hypnotized the whole world. Even in Germany, during the war, they called them their bingo. And he was just internationally one, two Academy Awards and really deserved each one. One movie called Country Girl, the other one going my way. And he taught us all how to make a living. So Bing Crosby was really sort of sad.

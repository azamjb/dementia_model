 Well, hey, I'm here to have a good season. Number one, I'm dead serious about. I'm very competitive. We're here to have fun. But bottom line is we've got to win once in ballgame. So I'm just a manager that likes to play hard, win, and try to be helped to players out as much as I can. They have a dream to play in the big leagues. And I had that opportunity. So I'm going to do everything I can to help them progress in their baseball.

 Black community. I have some black uh fans and uh  but I wouldn't say so as a judge. It's a rule I wouldn't think so because uh uh most of what I do is uh I put it much of a specialized field I guess you'd say. uh So I if you had to generalize, I would say that if you had to generalize the black community in the US, I would say that most of it would be contemporary uh music. It would not be in any way uh uh historical and reference. It doesn't seem to be the case.

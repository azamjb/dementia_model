 Black community. I have some black fans, but I wouldn't say so as a judge. It's a rule I wouldn't think so because most of what I do is I put it much of a specialized field I guess you'd say. So if you had to generalize, I would say that if you had to generalize the black community in the US, I would say that most of it would be contemporary music. It would not be in any way historical and reference. It doesn't seem to be the case.

 We discovered that there were only two record labels in the whole country, Eamine Decker. And essentially, there was only two hours a week of any kind of popular music. So for the whole of the week I remember with people who just literally go home to listen to this magic amount of music. And so that unless you know you're with the two established labels as an artist, it was virtually impossible to get off the ground.

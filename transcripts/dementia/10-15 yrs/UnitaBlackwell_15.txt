 I'm just glad to be in this because somebody deep down in my guts I know there was some role with the Bible that I read told me that just because you was white or whatever color you was you wouldn't know bitten me and now I didn't understand how that that scripture kept coming up with some of the slave masters what I call them slave masters because there's plantations no they kept saying that you know you're supposed to be a good slave a good servant and see I went to find it out through listening to other people give a description is how people interpret something or how they give it the description of it I felt it all of my life something was wrong with this kind of God that put me in the situation that this person was more than me just because of the color of my skin I didn't understand that but in this movement of the 60s that I became a part of I knew the real truth had nothing to do with God it had to do with the evil of us trying to make one group of people

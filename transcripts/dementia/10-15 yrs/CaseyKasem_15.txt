 I was quiet during the Vietnam War and I I did a lot of talking, but I only talked to people that I knew and what I should have been doing is probably getting out there and uh stretching out in front of some of those buses that were uh shipping supplies to to Vietnam. And uh at this time I I knew that I had a little more than that and and all of these things that I'm into, I like it to be hands on and not just talk because there's so many people who are talking about too much. uh God bless them for even thinking about it because that's important too. You plant seeds when you tell people things that you believe in. But you have to get out there and you have to hit the rallies and you have to uh use all of your resources to do whatever you can to turn things around and make this world a better place. So that's why we're involved the way we are and that's why we're outspoken and visible and so on.

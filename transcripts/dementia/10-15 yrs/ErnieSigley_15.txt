 I was a choir boy at uh Christchurch. I went to scholarship as a as a boy. I auditioned for the choir. So I got free education up until my my voice broke. And uh then when I finished, actually, while I was a choir boy, I was singing on swallow's tuners. I went in there and I went in the telequest. And I came second on it. And then I started singing on swallow's tuners. And there was a guy called Murray Callard. Murray Callard. It was a good, a good, an answer. And plus the studio manager. And I put my name down in the search up for a panel operator. Turned that operator on those stages, you know. Ah, for when it came up. Excuse me, when it came up, I started at the age of 14, at 3D, basically, a panel operator. That's how it all started. And then he went. Then we'd uh probably used to do breakfast with Dan. And he sort of, uh he was the one who used to plug me on the radio.

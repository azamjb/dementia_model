 one of those things that I was definitely in the right place at the right time. They had actually been looking for an actress to play Liesel for months. They had interviewed in New York, London, and LA, and couldn't find anyone. They started rehearsals without Liesel. And my mother was in Vodville, and an agent friend of hers, knew she had three daughters, and said, do you have one daughter who's over 18, who looks 16, and can sing and dance and act? They wanted an actress over 18, because they didn't want her to have to go to school on the set, because the role of Liesel was larger than that of the other children, and they didn't want to lose that time every day. So I went in, I met the casting agent. There was nobody there. I I couldn't get nervous, and I couldn't compare myself to anyone, because there was no one there. And I didn't know about the sound of music. I had never seen the play. And I hadn't really been clamoring to be an actress. I was working and going to college and saving money to travel. And I met with the casting director, and he had me come back the next day and read the 16 going on 17 scene, which I did. And then he caught me back again, and I met the director and read the scene for him. And then I had to come back the next day to sing 16 going on 17. And my mother and father both sang. It's just a genetic quality that I've inherited, our whole family sings. So I sang 16 going on 17. And then they caught me back the next day. And I danced for the choreographers. And I had studied dance since the time I was four. So that was the easy part of it. And I was hired. But I was only hired temporarily. They were afraid that my eyes were too blue and would not photograph well. This was in the days before they could digitize anything.

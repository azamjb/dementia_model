 happy with Andre the Giant. Now in WrestleMania 2, now when Brett and I finished the thing up with Andre the Giant, Andre threw me over the top and I was on the floor and then Brett charged Andre, Andre picks Brett up like this and I'm on the floor looking up at Andre and looking up at Brett's eyes. Brett's eyes are like this. He's looking to me, I'm looking at him like well you gotta be 20 something feet up there. I'll give it a try. And so Andre throws Brett on top of me, I grab like this and I try to hold my body straight and forget about it. We just want to bam.

 I'm in a room, there's 789 against two. We don't play a football game like that. Cello Kio handed me a piece of paper and said, as a precondition, I demand that you sign this. And I looked at that piece of paper and I started reading it. And I got down to an area that said, you must sign away the rights to ever negotiate preseason pay. And my lawyer took it from me. He said, ball of play, just ball of play gone and signed. I'm sitting down and saying, sign away the rights and perpetrate. That sounds like a hell of a long time. Our grandchildren are going to be playing for the same amount that I'm playing for. I can't believe this. So now I don't know who the trust I stood up and said, I got to talk to my attorney outside. I took that piece of paper. And I said to my lawyer, I will never. I will never sign it. And I put it in my pocket. That was the start.

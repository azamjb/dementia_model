 after they've been on for a couple of years. And uh there was so much about its approach, the multiple story lines, and uh that to which I gravitated. But I I I didn't feel, I I felt that it was a bit of a sanitized version of uh of what police work was having been incarcerated myself on a number of occasions, always through false accusations, misunderstood. um And uh so uh when I came on, the first character that I introduced was a character named Sal Benedetto, who was a bad cop, who was always beaten up, Charlie Hayden, and so on. And uh uh who seemed to me to be a more accurate representation of at least one aspect of policing. And uh he wound up uh, Benedetto wound up robbing a bank, and they send a robot in. He he was hiding in the vault, and they send a robot in so they can watch what he's doing. And he starts beating the robot with his fists. And he's a you know kind of unreconstrued, he's a luddite you know. He hates technology, hates all of it. Anyway, in those days, you couldn't have such a cop as a regular, and they made me kill him. But then, uh uh several years later, I was put in charge of the show. And so I brought the character back as Bunce, this guy.

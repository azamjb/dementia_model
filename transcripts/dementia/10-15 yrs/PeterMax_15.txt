 My most important thing that I have to do when I do a piece of artwork is to be mindless. I I take it in this case, a black piece of paper, some color pencils, and I don't want to know what's going to happen. I just let it occur. It's like a a jazz pianist sitting down and he's going to innovate some jazz. Either way, replace it.

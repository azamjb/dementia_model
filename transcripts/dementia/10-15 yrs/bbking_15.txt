 No, not necessarily when I was doing the music. I'm talking about that time, just times in your life. Time in your life. You feel that, for example, you might lose a close friend or something happens that don't necessarily have to be bad for you, but bad for somebody else. Bad in a lot of cases for people you don't even know. And you still feel, you know, impeding away or speaking because you can't do anything to help them, you don't know. Well, you're just there. For example, a few months ago or so, I was in Europe and I read about JFK Jr. Well, I had a chance to meet him when he was a teenager. His mother brought him and his sister by. We were playing Manhattan one night. And the ex-ferslated at that time, after the president was dead, brought the kids by, well, we were playing. So I had a chance to see him meet him. And then reading about him as wife and sister-in-law was all killed at one time, this hurt. It would have hurt me if I had not met him. But I had met him.

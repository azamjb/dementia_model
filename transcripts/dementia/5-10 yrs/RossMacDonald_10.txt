 or less uh immediately from life. And uh I find when I look at my stories after I've written them, uh they generally have a fairly high autobiographical content. They generally deal with uh problems that have arisen in my own life, or circumstances uh that have appeared in the lives of people around me, that I care about. The essence of it is the feeling that you have for the situation, rather than the price of the situation itself. I don't remember anybody ever giving me a plot that I used, except my wife. She's a great plotter. And I've given her plots, too. We both started in our early 20s as series writers, but we were doing different things. I was teaching high school, and she wrote some humor, and then uh branched off into the humorous mystery novel. Her first several books were humorous mysteries about a character named Paul Price, a psychiatrist, and uh uh undoubtedly her example led me into taking the the uh whole thing more seriously, and eventually writing a mystery fiction of my own. I started some years after she did.

 or less immediately from life. And I find when I look at my stories after I've ridden them, they generally have a fairly high autobiographical content. They generally deal with problems that have arisen in my own life, or circumstances that have appeared in the lives of people around me, that I care about. The essence of it is the feeling that you have for the situation, rather than the price of the situation itself. I don't remember anybody ever giving me a plot that I used, except my wife. She's a great plotter. And I've given her plots, too. We both started in our early 20s as series writers, but we were doing different things. I was teaching high school, and she wrote some humor, and then branched off into the humorous mystery novel. Her first several books were humorous mysteries about a character named Paul Price, a psychiatrist, and undoubtedly her example led me into taking the whole thing more seriously, and eventually writing a mystery fiction of my own. I started some years after she did.

 The Hannah family, the Columbus Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo, the zoo world, this is obviously a a a terrible tragedy, but however, we have given over tens of millions of dollars over the last years to the gorilla world, both lowly and in mountain gorillas. I I happen to have a home three miles where the gorillas live in Rwanda. That's the mountain gorillas. However, what you see here, you hear the screaming going, I hear it right now, you hear the screaming going, I'll watch that gorillas response by the way. He doesn't know what's going on. This is a silverback probably, not a female. He hears the response, you can see from the face in the mouth, he's alarmed. Yes, he goes over and looks at the little child there. They know that about that. What happens when you tranquilize the animal, whether it's a gorilla, uh whatever animal it might be? There's a new researcher in the wild with gorillas, I've seen what happens, so I know what happens. When that dart hits the animal, this animal, you can imagine, the animal, it's not, it's like a shot, but he jumps like this. So what would happen if he had a hole in that little boy? I've seen a silverback gorilla take a green coconut, but you can't even bust up with a hatchet and go like this. Beyond the strength of anything you'd ever know. So what choice would you have? Human life and animal life.

 Well, there's no other way anymore. I mean, I I've read Truman Capote, and I've read Erika Jean, and there's a new era. I mean, there's no way you could tell a story without going all out. And I was invited with money to to do the autobiography. And I thought, well, Evelyn Keys, who the hell is she? Who remembers? And if anybody remembers, who cares? So with that half-baked career I had, you know that wasn't very interesting. And that wouldn't be much of a story. So what do I have to offer? A dream. It's an American dream of a rather large number of us uh to go to Hollywood and be a star. uh And then what happens? you know It looks good from a distance. And you get there. And how do I clean this up? All things break loose.

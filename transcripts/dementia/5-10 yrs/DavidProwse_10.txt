 I did this Stanley Kubrick round me out one day. I said he was doing this film, a clockwork orange, and asked me if I would go up to this house in I think it was in Reblet up in North London. And we filmed this terrible movie. It was quite strange actually, because I mean, the first scene I did, I was doing nothing else, but carrying Alex, who was Malcolm McDowell, down the stairs. And I did it all day, like, non-stop. And at the end of the day, I could hardly move, I could hardly move my arms. And then Stanley turned around to me. He said, to the next day, he said, we're going to do this thing where you can carry Patrick McGee down the stairs in his wheelchair. I said, hang on a minute. I said, oh, I said, you know, I said, you know, I said, you know, one take Kubrick, you know? And he said, all we do is quick as we can, you know? And we shot the scene in about three or four takes. He was a hard taskmaster to work for, but a lovely guy. I loved him. I got him very, very well with him. And then of course, you know, that came out in 1971, I think it was. And luckily for me, George Lucas saw it, because it was out very, very briefly, because it was, it created a lot of bad publicity and over the content of the film. And anyway, I said, Lucas saw it in the very brief period that it was out. And I remember me for five years and then came to London and set himself up in the 20th Century Fox offices in London, Central London. And got in touch with the Managing Director and said, look, do me a favor. Can you find me this great day, you press? And then I got called in. They said to me, I said, well.

 They absolutely squirreling with love. He he sort of drags a couple up to to sort of sit and have dinner on the stage. And he just keeps on saying, come on, finish eating and everything like that. Have some more wine and blah, blah, blah. And they just up on the stage having dinner just you know as part of the show, just sort of minding their own business. So look truly, and I see Barry Humphries as a person is one of the nicest people I've ever met. The the only age just ago I did this sort of little special for Voxel and everything. And I wanted Barry to sort of bring on it. And he was working uh as Fagan in Oliver in in London. And so he had to go into the theatre, be hooked up in the theatre. And I said, don't, it's not paying very much. This sort of, you know, uh guess appears. He said, journey for you, I'll do it for nothing. Is it what? And he was doing eight shows a week at the time. And I just cannot say enough about his graciousness.

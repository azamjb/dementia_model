 was something that people had been striving for, had been hoping for for for decades. The literature of the 1930s is a repeat with the examples of uh of noise reduction systems that had been designed. And that activity carried on, uh at least until the outbreak of the Second World War, everyone was hoping for some some way of reducing noise, and no one had succeeded. uh the The cure always seemed to be worse than than the disease. And naturally I was fascinated by this problem. I had been working at Ampex, and uh the the problem of noise was well known and understood by the engineers working in that field. My recognition that the noise is really very, very small in comparison with the loudest signal that one deals with in sound recording. uh The professional recorders at that time had signal to noise ratio of nominally 60 decibels. That's a voltage ratio of a thousand to one. In other words, the for a maximum signal height of this much, this the noise is extremely small, one tenth of one percent. And and all previous noise reduction efforts had uh

 Well, you know, I met Deborah Carr doing one of those radio shows and TN simply would have been a completely different play. Ingrid did it, many famous people did it, but Deborah set the mark on that play. And this was really serendipity because I lived in the garden department of the people who owned the theater guild. I was my first wife and I lived there. And I, as I said, used to write about eight shows and I was working on a play and I didn't want to write the next show that they wanted me to write. And it was a show called Remember the Day, a play by Philip. I forgot. Anyway, I didn't like the play particularly. And Al Mino Marshall, who was Mrs. Liner, came down and begged me to do it. And I said, Al Mino, I really don't like the play and I'm busy on something else. And she said, well, we'll have the apartment painted for you if you do it. And I said, Al Mino, please, please don't bribe me like that. And then we had a garden outside, which being the garden department, we had the garden. And she said, she went out and looked at it. She said, do you know the walls all need painting? And I said, Al Mino, I really just don't like the play. I finally did it and I met Deborah Carr on that show. Just accident. And I said to her at the end, she was on her way to Hollywood. She hadn't even met the Hollywood yet. All the theaters and movies out there, wonderful early movies. And I said that, you know, Deborah, I hope I get to do a play for you sometime. And she said, well, I'm off to Hollywood.

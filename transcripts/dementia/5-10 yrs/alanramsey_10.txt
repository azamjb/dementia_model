 Pretty joins us to one, Virginia, I have to say. I have no uh real uh love for the two leaders. I think that the poorest leaders I've seen, and and consequently we've seen the poorest campaigns, it's all been about prejudice. It's been about not a debate about policy. It's been about prejudice, about fear, about those sorts of things, attacking one another very, very negative campaigns. But once again, by two leaders that I had no no uh real support for, I thought the two leaders that should have been there were Rudd and Turnbull, and that would have been a genuine choice for the voters. I I mean, I think Gillard is an accident, and I think Tony Abbott got there when the Liberal Party split. He won, he got the leadership by one vote, 43, 42. God knows how it happened, but I would say that if Turnbull had been the leader, that would have been no contest. He would he would have absolutely given Gillard a bath in this campaign

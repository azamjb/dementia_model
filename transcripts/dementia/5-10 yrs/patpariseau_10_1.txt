 So I'm going to do it. I have had a great ride. I actually got dragged into politics by my husband. He was the person who was interested in politics. It wasn't me. So when his friend came over to visit him because my my father-in-law died um and to bring condolences, he said, we're having caucus. Would you like to join us, Kenneth? Because I know you love politics. And he said, sure, I'll come. So the next morning at breakfast, I he said, you became a delegate. What? And you do what? And what do you do next? Well, you go to a convention and say, and do what? So I go there and they try to make me the chairroom because they had some fresh blood. They said, oh, we'll dump one of these big, you know. I said, wait, you know I can't do it. I don't even know what I'm doing here. So I went through that day and the next day I went home and I said, don't ever do that to me again. So the next year, he went to the convention and then they made me the chairwoman. I said, and you were doing what? I was watching the coffee pot. He drank the whole thing too. At any rate. So that was my untreated politics. But after I ran, I I actually spent 15 years of volunteer work for the party um on other people's campaigns trampling all over the state from Tony Anz up in the North Country to um Elden, Medallin, and Down in the Corner for um in Lewiston and all different people everywhere.

 Well, some people, you know, there are some people who will recall at the word trapping. What's the difference between shooting an animal or trapping an animal if it dies? It dies. And it's in the same condition. So you have to kind of think about how you can mix people together and they'll get along better. And that's one of the things that I do is curious, more, I'd like for the Trappers Association. Even though there are people here who are members of the association, but don't carry water very often for them. So I decided I'll be that person, I don't mind it. And keep in touch with them very closely.

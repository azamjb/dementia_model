 I started in San Francisco in 1956, my twin sister, I started three months before in Chicago and Landers. She started in Houston. She started and then um uh three months later, I used to go to the Chronicle of San Francisco. They were running Molly Mayfield, who was out of Denver. Molly Mayfield. Molly Mayfield and it was an an agony column. It really wasn't very good. So I read it and I said, I can do this. So into the Chronicle of San Francisco, the Hawke Arnold, the editor, I just really gusts my way in. And uh I said, I could do a much better column than this Mayfield person. He said, listen, we're very busy, but I'll tell you what we'll do. So he called a copy boy and said, get about six weeks calmed down by Mayfield and bring them over here. So he said, well, what do you do? I said, I'm a Hillsboro housewife. I didn't have a social security number. I never worked a day of my life. I did volunteer work. I was a great lady in hospitals. And I worked for the UJA in the United Crusade. So what did he have you do, answer letters? He said, yes, he brought the letters back. And he said, you use the letters put to her strike out the answers and write in your own and bring them back in about a week. OK, took the stuff with me. And he said, don't call us, we'll call you. Leave your name at the desk. Let's name it the desk. Went to my husband's office about three blocks from the Chronicle. Got behind a typewriter and I went to work. Ducks suit, easy, one-liners. As I don't know how, it was back at the Chronicle. And he said, he said, he's a great man.

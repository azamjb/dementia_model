Well I I was um I was born in Dublin uh and my um parents or uh Irish uh and um my father decided for uh reasons which I've never entirely been able to sort out though I can guess I suppose I decided to leave Ireland. Uh when I was one I was removed therefore to London where he went into civil service. so I grew up in London uh although I went to Ireland for the holidays and I I feel extremely Irish and I feel very involved in Ireland and whats happneing in Ireland now but I I grew up in london and um uh I went to a boarding school and then I went on to Oxford

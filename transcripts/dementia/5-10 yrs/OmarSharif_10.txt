 And it's, he is a strange person because he sits there and he only exists when the boy walks in. He doesn't talk to the other customers. The fact that the boy is Jewish and the man is Muslim would be an irrelevant thing to the film. The film is not concerned with that problem at all in itself, the story. If the Jews and the Israelis and the Palestinians had made peace already, it would be totally irrelevant the whole thing. But where it's relevant, it's because there is all that conflict between Israelis and Palestinians because there are other conflicts between Islam now and the rest of the world. We're going towards a very dangerous people because we're cruising ahead towards the real war of cultures and civilizations and religion. And the powerful Western countries always being on the side of Israel against the Palestinian. I'm not saying that. You should, first of all, before you can solve the Palestinian and the Jewish problem, you have to get rid of both Sharon and Afat Mas'ko. These are two incompatible people. They've hated each other for ages. They're not going to start loving each other now. They're not going to make deals together.

 Well, I'm not sure how I'm going from there, but it may be of interest to you to know that I was acquainted with CS Lewis. In my time at the University of Oxford, as a student and a graduate student, I went frequently to meetings of the Socratic Club, an organization which he founded and for certainly through most of the forties and the fifties chaired. You might also be interested to know that in his later life he became very distressed about evil because basically he was confronted with the choice. Are things good because God says so or does God approve of them because they were good and he couldn't see the way out of any way other than saying that absolute power is its own justification, as Calvin and others said? And in view of the fact that the traditional religion is committed to the idea that most of God's creatures are going to be tortured forever for the things that he makes them do. The whole of Christian seism is a nightmare to me.

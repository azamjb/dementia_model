 you know something when I when I start a painting I don't want to know what I'm painting. All I want to do is I pick up a color and I'm going to put it like an upper right hand corner. Then I want to match it with something else I put another. Once I've got a bunch of colors then something wants to happen and I go along with it. So it's not like I start out and say oh I'm going to do two profiles next to each other. But I may sometimes pick up a brush and do a profile and then I'll decide to do another one and that's how it happens. I let the it occur just like a jazz musician sometimes sits down and he just dabbles and before you know as he repeats it and repeats it and suddenly people go.

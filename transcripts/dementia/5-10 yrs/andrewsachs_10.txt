Sometimes it goes very wrong and it's up to them to do better. Both apologize to me, but it's a very nice little, very nice. I appreciate this response too.

There was a lot of traffic around here, hardly here. And at the end, it didn't sound very nice. And at the end, he called me and he said, I said it sounded weird, I didn't, I don't understand why. I don't know if the Russell were interviewing me, suppose, if he wasn't there, I wouldn't have. And he said, well yeah, no. Are you alright for what? I said, we're not really. He said, would you like to do the whole thing again next week if you're free? I said, that's a good idea. Then you can cut everything you've done. And we'll have a problem. And that's the last thing I've ever done.

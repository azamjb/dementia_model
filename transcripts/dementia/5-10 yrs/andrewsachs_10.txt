 I have decided, I didn't didn't need to decide, I'm not going to take it anywhere. I'm not out for revenge or anything like that. These two performers, I'm a performer. Sometimes it goes very wrong and it's up to them to do better. Both apologize to me, but it's a very nice little, very nice. I appreciate this response too. And uh flowers, look for me, I hope, or my wife, I guess. He contacted me, I was I was in the street listening to this, they uh transferred some of that recorded stuff onto my mobile. There was a lot of traffic around here, hardly here. And at the end, it didn't sound very nice. And at the end, uh he was he called me and uh uh he said, I said it sounded weird, I didn't, I don't understand why. I don't know if the Russell were interviewing me, suppose, if he wasn't there, I wouldn't have. And he said, well yeah, no. uh Are you alright for what? I said, we're not really. He said, would you like to do the whole thing again next week if you're free? I said, that's a good idea. Then you can cut everything you've done. And we'll have a problem. And that's the last thing I've ever done.

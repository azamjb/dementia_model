 Norman who had broken shy, yes. He used to announce a radio show called The United States Steel Theater of the Air. And I used to listen to him. And I would repeat the words I heard on the air. To lighten my A, you see the difficulty with my speech was a very deep A in follow. And the rhythmic pattern had to be broken. I had to become accustomed to the rhythmic pattern of speaking in America. I had to get away from the Caribbean. So I would listen for patterns and I would listen for A's. You see. So instead of saying, Bach, I would say Bach. And yeah, instead of saying Bach, I would say that. And it took me about a year to lighten the A, you know, and become more familiar with the rhythm of speaking English in America. And then I went back to the American theater and tried out. And I got up on the stage, of course, with my new speech. And I got so scared I slipped right back into a hole.

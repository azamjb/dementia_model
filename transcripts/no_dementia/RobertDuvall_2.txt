 Not intimidated, but with a good health and respect. I had worked with Brando before on the chase and had met him. And I think many young actors in America, you know, at one time looked up to Brando, maybe still. And I think that served the project. We all sat around and rehearsed up on Patsy's restaurant on the Upper East Side, you know, beneath Harlem. And we sat as a family and ate and talked about the project. Brando was at the head of the table, you know, you know, there. It was great. And I was over here in sunny Jimmy who's great to work with Jimmy Con, Al. And I think we deferred him in a healthy way without being intimidated, you know, because we were coming into our own. And, you know, I think you have heroes when you're young. I was with somebody recently that said he never had a hero. He's a great horseman. He had a, you know, on the circuit that ran pre-writer. And his book he said he never had a hero. And he's a great writer, but I, you know, I always felt it's okay to have heroes when you're young. And as you get older and develop, maybe you don't have as many. But I think Brando was a hero to many people. It was a good and bad, but I think he was a hero in a way. And that served the fictional as well, you know, coming from the world.

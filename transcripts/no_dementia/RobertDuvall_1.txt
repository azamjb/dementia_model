 Well, I was never really close friends with John, but he joined kind of the group in Ulu and all of us, we had a production of a view from the bridge off Broadway, in which Dusty was the assistant stage manager. It was before Dusty had made his mark, really, you know. And so he was always getting the bones, you know. I took him along to a naked city, he said to Herbert Leonard, the producer, read this kid, he's terrific. So and then somebody else that happened was so marrying Dirty, he said, when you're not acting, I'll let you be a casting agent if you want. But Dusty, then he kind of like catapulted, you know, in some ways, in some obvious ways, more than all of us, you know. His start had been, and it was like the old days really, that it doesn't happen that way anymore, you know. When he did the graduate, he just went, he took off. But it's funny, you know, when you talk about that, and Jimmy Conn and I were good friends for a while, but like, I was at Jimmy Conn's house one time, and there's a nucleus of Mexican gardeners in the LA district that's kind of, they've kind of taken over the work from the Japanese gardeners. And I said to Jimmy's gardener from Mexico, oh, you work for Gene Hackman, what does he live? So he told me, I went and knocked on a door and had him see him in a couple of years, as it's a Jimmy's gardener who's your gardener, told me where you live. Because the point I'm making is when people begin to make it, it seems you never see each other again. Go this way, you go this way, you go this way, and I don't see those guys much anymore. I don't know why, it's just one of those things. I like to see Gene again because he and I had certain things in common, we used to ride horses and he likes to play ten, I play ten, you know.

 I think I was around 12 or 13, Frankenstein and Dracula on a double bill, big screen, beautiful prints. And I saw those. I see now that there's someone's actually showing them now, going around on Halloween and showing them. If you haven't had a chance to see Dracula, the original little Dracula, Legosi's Dracula in a big screen and a beautiful print. It's just a gorgeous movie. And I was blown away by the craft of those films. And I was therefore disappointed by some of the garbage, the 50s, the cheap way they were shot. And I couldn't at that time view them as pulp. Now I can sort of celebrate the pulp aspect of it. But at that time, I was looking for that beautiful photography. And it was nothing. It was a flat day shot. I'm in eight days. And so I was always disappointed by those. And more drawn to the older films. And in all genres, I mean, my aunt, I had an aunt and uncle who took me to see, I wanted to go see the new Tarzan, Lex Sparker, was just going to be replacing Johnny Weissbauer. And I wanted to go see that. And they said, no.

 my marriage with Stella. I've always composed, but I've never had anything paid for an orchestra. So she said to me, why didn't you write it and orchestrate it? So I did. I orchestrated the whole piece through a friend of mine. And she said to Andrea Rio, the Dutch conductor. And I was in Mexico City some years ago, five, six years ago, doing publicity on a movie. And the phone rang in my hotel room. And I said, Andrea Rio, is this a joke? You know, your wife sent me the manuscript, the score. Would you like me to hear our rehearsal this morning? So you played a recording of the rehearsal. So we went to Holland within the next couple of months. And before 8,000 people sat there.

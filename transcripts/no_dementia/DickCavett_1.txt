 I'm sure there were plenty of people who said, I know you're not going to understand you want to do a serious part, but really, there's a scene in which you're going to have to find out your son has been killed in this thing. And people are going to expect a pie to come off. That's what you've been hit with by, is that off? You know what I mean? There was so moving the way you did that scene. You didn't seem to do very much at all. Is there any way you can tell us how you were guiding yourself from within when the men came to you and gave the news that you sent him and killed him?

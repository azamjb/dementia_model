 We're working a lot and having fun, then keeping, you can't hit a moving target, and I'm writing and producing a show over in Hawaii, a fundraiser, Edith had a knife, we're putting on a fashion show with all of you, this Academy Award winning clothes, and I was getting the animals for it, at the Royal Hawaiian, and we lost Edith. So we're gonna do the show as a tribute to her, and still have all her fashions and all the animals, and surprise celebrities, and it's an exciting scare.

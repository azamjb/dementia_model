 Well, I think we had our chance. We adopted all kinds of legislation. Politics is cyclical. People wanted to slow down a little bit and review and consolidate. That was the Reagan era. And I think they were having their high tide then. And then it started coming back under Obama. But then I think the pressure of the problems, the overwhelming nature of the challenges we have now has caused Americans to want to step back and look a little bit. But we had that time when we had 68 senators on the Democratic side. We had a liberal court under Earl Warren. We had Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson and the White Us. And we were.

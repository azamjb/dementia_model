 I think there is. I mean, I do believe that is the way it's going. Unless something really is done about it, it could end up that way. In fact, I modeled the idea originally on... I'd been to one of the cities that left the biggest impression on me of all the places I think I've been to was Hong Kong. And Hong Kong is a sort of crowded zone. It's probably, I think, the most crowded zone in the world, isn't it? On a peninsula or island, it's Kalun. And it was incredibly impressive in its multi-textures, multinational conglomeration of everything. And it was kind of interesting. I liked it, actually. And it stayed with me for years. I haven't been there for 10 years. It's still stayed with me. So when this film came along, I suddenly started to see a city that way.

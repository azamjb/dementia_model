 There was the scene in Godfather One, if anybody remembers it, when Michael, young Michael, gets married in Sicily and he has to pass around candies. It's a tradition, an Italian tradition. And then Francis says, okay, Al, here's the thing, you pass around the candies, you go to the different people, and then you take the girl who's your wife and you do a wall thing, you go off in the car. So I thought, okay, I said, Francis, you say you want me to talk to an Italian to these people that I'm passing the candy bars, I don't speak Italian. You said, well, it doesn't matter, I mean, just say anything. Whatever, you know, I mean, double talk, because I'm way up with the camera, we'll get it later, you know, don't worry about the things, just wall surround with the girl. So it said, Francis, I don't wall.

 The hardest thing to do is to choose your subject. It's like being a painter. When you first begin, there's a million options on because in one sense, what am I going to make this film about? What is my story? As you get more experienced or older, your choices become more focused. So right now, this time, I only have about four things really in process in development that are fundamentally written and are being polished. I don't have a list of 40 or 50 subjects. When I first started, I didn't know what to do other than the fact I knew I wanted to make a film. I couldn't get a camera until I wrote a script, which is the best lure in the world. You want that ball-X, which is a clock-white camera, you're right, the screenplay. So that moment was into James Joyce and particularly Eulaceys with all his descriptive, wonderful descriptive passages. And so for the moment, I became James Joyce for a couple of months. I sat down and literally wrote a screenplay. Off the screenplay, I got to borrow the film and got the camera. I made a film with my brother, which scored more in the bicycle, which actually I thought was the starting box there.

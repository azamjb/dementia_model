 And within two months the suicide came along. I loved it and I knew it had been very well done on a great success with the RSC here in England. And it was going to be directed by a man who'd left the Soviet Union in 1975. Had been asked to leave. And the combination seemed too good to me. I mean everything seemed to be slotting into place. It was a fairy story come true. And so I ended up on Broadway. Every act I think longs for one part that does it for him. And I think perhaps Gaudier's was that part for me. I hope it's not the only one. I see it not as the end of a career, but it's certainly a peak in a career, in a mountain range. Strangies were mentioned Charles Lawton because he was the one immediately thought of when I Gaudier's was ever mentioned because he started to play it in a movie version in 1938. And the BBC showed me what was left of it in order to in a way lay the ghost of Lawton and do it for myself. In a way I love playing unsympathetic parts because I don't get to play with him any of them. I play, I seem to play a lot of victims and a lot of sympathetic roles. Deedrick was a real bastard and a bastard that won. I mean he came out on top at the end. I think the only way you could take him at all was the fact that he was so outrageous and so awesome.

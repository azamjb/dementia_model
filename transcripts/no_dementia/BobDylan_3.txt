 Well, my stuff were songs. They weren't sermons. They came out of the folk music realm. I wrote a song about the death of Medgar Evers. And the first line is a bullet from the back of the bush took Medgar Evers blood. Finger fired the trigger to his name. But I, with a point I'm trying to make is that it's all in the eliteration of the lines. A bullet from the back of the bush took Medgar Evers blood. It's true it's written about somebody. And it's true it's written about a real thing. But it's also done with a rhythm and a certain type of poetic nuance that I don't know how I derived that. I got all that into a particular song.

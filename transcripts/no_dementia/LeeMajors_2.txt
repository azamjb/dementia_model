 I worked at a recreation park, I was a park director, while I was in training for an actor and was doing stunts. And yes, I worked for the Recreation Parks Department, and then when I got my first job, I stayed at the park for another, because I wasn't sure the pilot of the big valley was gonna go, so I stayed working at the park. And finally, after about two years, I sent in my resignation after the series of dawn about three years.

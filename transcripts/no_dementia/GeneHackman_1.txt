 true that as concentrated as we were in the film and as soon as the scene was over, he and the other little boy, Huckleberry Fox, they would be right back to doing whatever they were doing. Usually it was playing dungeons and dragons, this very complex game that they were involved in. It's more of a way of life, I think. Yeah, he would surprise us, all of us actually, in that he could be very sophisticated at times. And then as soon as it was over, go off and edit it. He was never, I can never recall a time in the filming where he wasn't prepared though, and he wasn't ready to go.

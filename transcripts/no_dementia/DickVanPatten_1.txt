 The first time I still feel badly, I don't know whether it was a mistake or not. The Aedis enough went on hiatus, you know? Right. And the day after that it went on hiatus, his friend of mine, an actor, very good actor, David Huddleston. Oh, excuse me. I'm doing this new play with Carl Reiner, the roast. He's a terrific part of it, and if you, he said, you should really do it. Well, I didn't really want to do it because I just started eight-week vacation, you know? But I didn't have the heart to tell him, no, I should have. I should have been a man and said, no, David, I don't want to do it. But I said, gee, that would be nice. Well, the next day he went to Carl Reiner, and the next day Carl Reiner, of course, me, I'd be like, he's sticky, he want to do the play, that's wonderful. So I said, well, I'll send the script right over, but we have to know by tomorrow morning, you know? So I read the script, and it was a good script, it's very funny, I mean, it's used some really funny stuff in it. And the part would have been interesting for me to play and everything, but I didn't know, I didn't really want to do it because I wanted the eight-week vacation. And in the meantime, David Huddleston, such a nice guy, he took me to Jimmy Cagney's house for St. Patrick's Day party, you know? Was fun to me, Jimmy Cagney, St. Patrick's Day, he sang for it, was marrying everything. And he was a part of that all because of David Huddleston. And he wants me to be in the place that we could have fun. And Carl Reiner's calling me up. I don't know how to say no, I don't want to do it. And I finally did, I just say no.

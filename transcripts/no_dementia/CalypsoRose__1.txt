 Yeah, no other thing I'll go back into competition. You see there's nothing more there for me to take. I have taken five female consecutive crunks. And then I won the road march twice and then the Calypso Monarch, I would only personally, first person to win such title. I won the Monarch, the Queen, the road march first and second in one year is nothing more there for me. So what I could do is to compose for other female Calypso Monarchs and let them go out and grab the crunk and die what I want. 95 will be a dangerous year because I'll tell you, I wouldn't call the names, but there'll be two top female Calypso Monarchs, we'll be giving those men troubling Trinidad and believe me. It's every other thing they say so. When I want to hear sweet soccer music, I always tune in to culture share. G-B-T.

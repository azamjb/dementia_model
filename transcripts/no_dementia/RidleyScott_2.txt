Because when you read the book, the book was so vividly portrayed a blow-by-blow, second-by-second process and cause an effect which really became the anatomy of a war. So from my point of view as a filmmaker and storyteller, we always looking for a good story, a good tale. So that's where I was looking to begin with. And I looked at the process, I love process. And I love cause and effect. And because right in there, you find all the best people. Or you find people at their extremities, stretched to their extremities. And that's why it becomes interesting.

Then I remember the event, of course, but it was like a glimpse, a flash of two bodies being dragged through the streets, a negotiation for a pilot called Durant, who was released after 11 days. And it was over. I wonder what the hell was that all about? And there it was. Here it was. An army annoyed with government, government and embarrassed about the process. And what followed was Clinton's decision or Clinton's government cabinet decision to essentially remove ground forces, military.

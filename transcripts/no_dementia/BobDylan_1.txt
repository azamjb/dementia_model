 Well, I put the tracks down about myself and decided what I wanted on the record and then had it mixed at a later time. Whereas earlier I would have done the whole thing all at one time with a producer who recorded and mixed it at the same time and I just didn't feel like I wanted to do that anymore. Why not? Well, you know, you use other people's ideas and sooner or pretty soon you're just you're not aware anymore of what you're worth a quit. If someone else is putting stuff on or mixing things or leaving things out that you might have wanted on and I just just feel like I didn't really have to do that.

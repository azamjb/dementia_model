 they were all live. I found it extremely difficult thing to do partly because I tried to remain true to the traditions of the lecture, which is that if you make a statement, you have to prove it. Now that's okay when you're talking about producing carbon dioxide by pouring hydrochloric acid on marble chips, that's fine. But when you want to say something about animal behavior, animals aren't just chemical substances, they have minds of their own. And also not only that, but they have to run to time. So you had to produce a series of experiments in which animals were going to do things, and if they didn't do it in the time allocated, well then you just had to move on.

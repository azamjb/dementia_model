 I think was with Stephen Queen only because when I went to see him for the part, he told me I was wrong for the part and wasn't, you know, I shouldn't be there. Well he gave me the part. But then I thought, my God, what if he replaces me because he thinks I'm not right. And I had just gone to Lee Strossberg to learn to act. I mean, here I was acting for years and years and years with no training. And I wanted so much to bring that out. But I didn't want to do it where I wasn't working and so I got so nervous that I lost my voice and I got laryngeitis and he came up to me one day and he put his arms around me and he said, Linda, I understand. I've been really nervous in my life doing parts. He said, you go to your hotel room, you don't talk to anybody for a week, nothing. You will come back and we'll work. And we came back and he said, okay, let's do it. And my God, he helped me so much to do this part and I was so proud of myself when I finished because it was everything I wanted to do. It was, I think the part I'm the most proud of.

 How I met Mel Brooks? Well, it was all through Carl Reiner. What happened? You remember the Dick Van Dyke show? Well, when the Dick Van Dyke show went off the air, Carl Reiner wrote and produced a new Dick Van Dyke show. Most people don't know about it because there wasn't on that long. So I had to go up and read for Carl Reiner to play Dick Van Dyke's boss. So I read and Carl Reiner said, you've got the part. I like you. So then we worked together every week on the new Dick Van Dyke show, hope Leying played his wife on that show. And so he said to me, he said, you have a tennis court in your house, don't you? And I said, yes. He said, you know, every Sunday, my friends are like, we rent a court, and we play, would it be all right if we came over to your house? And you include you when we all play together? I said, sure, come over Sunday about 12 o'clock. So he comes over that Sunday. He brings the Allerolder with him, Jean Wilder, Jean Wilder's wife, you remember, and Mel Brooks. And all these people, I couldn't get over it. So then we played every Sunday at one o'clock we played. And one day we were playing, Carl Reiner was playing with Mel, and I was playing with Allerolder. And during the tennis match, Mel Brooks called me over. He said, Dick, he said, I'm doing a new series, a TV series called When Things Were Rotten. It's all about Robin Hood. And it's gonna be like a farce comedy. He said to me, he said, Dick, would you like to play Fry a Tuck? I said, yeah, would I? I said, but this is the big fat man. He said, yeah, he said, I know you.

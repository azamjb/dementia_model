 about that? Well, yeah, John came to the prison that I was in to do a show and I paid a trustee five cartons of cigarettes to take some of my songs and give them to Johnny Cash. Johnny Cash wrote a letter to the Pearl Ward in the state of Ohio and asked him to commute my sentence from death wrote a life in prison. He said he thought I was the greatest living songwriter in the world. So five years later they commuted my sentence from death wrote and to life in prison and they sent me to the Marion Correctional Institution in Marion, Ohio and after two years I was released on parole and allowed to go to Nashville to pursue my career as a songwriter and a singer and ten years later with the help of all my friends in Nashville that signed a paper the governor of the state of Ohio restored me to my rights as an American citizen.

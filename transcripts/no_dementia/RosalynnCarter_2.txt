 Well, it was, I was devastated when Jimmy lost the election and we wrote this book, everything to gain about our feelings. The first chapter of that book is about the crises losing the election and having to come home and about how I felt and how Jimmy felt. The next day we're still president could go on, had responsibilities and duties and that he had to do. Well, short time in there before I got very busy with Christmas activities at the White House, there was a time when I just didn't know what we're going to do. I think we knew the one you were going to do, we had not planned to go home. I thought going back to planes would be the end of the world, it was devastating. But as we wrote in the book, we got home, we were swamped, we had lived in our house in ten years, we had agreed to write books, we had to raise $25 million to be able to call the presidential library and so we immediately had to just dig in and do so many things that helped you get over that herd and do.

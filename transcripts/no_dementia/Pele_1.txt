 You know, some people, those people who criticized me, the newspaper, they write a lot of things, they said, oh, I should ask for a play in Mexico, but they didn't understand. I have nothing against Mexico. I love Mexico. I have a friend that they support us, tremendous in the 70s. And Brazil was, you know, tried to bring to Brazil, too. I should say no, let's fight for Brazil. Let's fight for Mexico. But I think for the soccer today, that time of the life, because Brazil have a problem, economic problem, Mexico have a economic problem, all over the world have some problem. And in the United States, the soccer has grown now. It started to become important. And for soccer, in general, will be better here.

 He's about, I played Jack Ryan again, as I did in Patriot games. The story is about an illegal war against the Colombian drug cartels being conducted by the President, the National Security Advisor, and the Operations Branch of CIA. And Jack Ryan has now been elevated to the head of intelligence of CIA. He finds out about this campaign against the drug cartels. And when he asks, he insists that they shut it down because it's illegal. And because he's a good guy and he knows what's right. And when they shut it down, they leave a number of soldiers down there. And Ryan becomes incensed about that and goes down to Columbia and helps get him out.

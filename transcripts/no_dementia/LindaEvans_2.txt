 Yeah, I had been up for a Disney movie that they had done. We're doing, and they were going to do it. They said six months right in Los Angeles, I could stay home. I could work for six months. I had worked with the director before. I'd worked at the studio. I had worked with the leading man. I thought, oh, this is my answer to prayer. I just know life is going to be so great. And they're going to give me this part. And I went in, and of course, they gave it to somebody else. And I was just heart sick. I thought, oh, this is just what I needed. So I thought, OK, I have to keep my faith. Something is going to come. I am going to get a part. I am going to work. It's going to be OK. And they called me about four weeks later and said we're replacing the actress. It hasn't worked. We want you to come back. I thought, aha, life was testing me. They're going to give me the part. And they just want life wanted to see if I would believe. I went back in, and then they gave it to somebody else again. I thought, oh, no. What do I mean? I said, OK, something is coming for me. And about two months later, Dynasty came up. I went in to see them. And had I been doing that film, I would have still been working and not able to do the pilot. Yeah, interesting. So I took that as that sometimes that life has your dream coming to you. And it seems in the moment that it's not looking very good, but to have faith. They have patients to know that what you want will come to you.

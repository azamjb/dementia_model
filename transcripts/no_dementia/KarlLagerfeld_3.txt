 It's up to them to impose them. I don't know. I made never an effort to impose myself. It hadn't like this. I wasn't questioned. I don't know why. I think it's the top of luxury. I would be bought to desensitop. When I started Chanel, I made two ready to wear and two high fashion collection. Now I make eight. And most of them were initiated by me. The cruise was unimportant. We made it really an important event. Now, every two months, because there are six collections, there's a pre-collection, and the main collection. And they do the same kind of business. There are every two months a collection that shops, the windows, everything can be changed. And it's me who initiated this. Don't even because the sense of business is because I thought it was just right for that brand, Buster.

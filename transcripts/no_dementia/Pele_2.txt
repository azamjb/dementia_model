 When I retired, it sent us, you know, I was already a champion of the world in 17s in Mexico. In 74, Santos was a champion in SÃ£o Paulo, from the league. I was the best scorer on the league. Then I retired. And at that time, I had a lot of proposals to go to play in Europe, England, Italy, Spain, Mexico. But I said, no, after 18 years, I went to rest because I was going to retire. Then, up here, the proposed to go to New York because they want to make the soccer big in the United States. That was the reason, you know, I come back to play. Then I started my mission. And now I am here because of this, you know, because we're going to revive New York Cosmos. To me, it's fantastic because I started with New York Cosmos, become a very big sport in the United States. And now we come back.

 We're not operating under the assumption that although we won looks like we're going to win with over 80 million votes, looks like we're going to have 306 or 465th exact number electoral votes, but I didn't expect it to go smoothly. The president signaled from even before the election began that he thought that he implied that it wasn't going to be fair, you know, it's absentee ballot things, it's mail-in ballots, things of the post office, but I was confident, and I really mean this, I think we had this discussion, but the American people are going to show up. The American people were not going to be silenced, and they showed up in record numbers in the middle of a pandemic. Some stood in line for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 hours. So I was confident the American people would speak, I must tell you, I wasn't confident the president would accept the voice that they sounded. We felt good about this election from the beginning, and didn't take anything for granted, but I have not surprised by the response of the president.

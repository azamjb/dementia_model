 Because it was such a hard, there was many, much of the film was very arduous to shoot. And the whistle hit can creak because of these huge lighting setups. We have to deal with owls and frogs and all kinds of things that are difficult to deal with. And then we had this one fabulous, where we didn't have any of the principles in it. We just had this sort of cheap horror film we were shooting with all these girls, whatever college that was supposed to be. And we just had a lot of fun. Using a study cam, I'd never used one of those before. And with study cam shots, as you sort of choreograph things, you get different ideas and you change it. And you adjust the players in the position of the camera to make the shot flow as seamlessly as possible. This whole thing when it goes into the shower and then we see him, it's the guy holding the knife in the mirror. Who was basically a pretty scary looking guy that I think he was not exactly old there either. So getting him to be in the right position when Garrett pans over to see him in the mirror. And then for the poor girl that has to stay in the shower during the whole shot until we come on and pull the curtain side, we had a lot of fun. We really enjoyed it.

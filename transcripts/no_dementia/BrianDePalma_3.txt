 Well, I came into an audition. We were in a loft in the village, and we had put an ad in the village voice. We were just seeing one actor after another. And then the sort of timid kid came in, the last one in. And we had him do a little improvisation, and we saw it. Hey, this kid's pretty good. And he said, OK, but there's something I've been preparing in my class. Could I show it to you? The kid had the part. OK. So he goes outside, and then we were sitting around, and you know, like, 5, 10, 15. Now we figured we'd have gone home. And then he came in into this incredible scene from the strike, the Clifford O'Deuts play, the attack about the taxi strike. It's romantic and raving, you know. If you think, holy mackerel, that's Bob's in here.

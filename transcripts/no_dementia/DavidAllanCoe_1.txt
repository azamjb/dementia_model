 with my relationships with women. Don't get me wrong. When I first got out of prison, it was, hey, cut, hand me that thing, and if you're not fast enough, I knocked your fucking brains out. And now it's, hey, babe, how about getting me a glass of water, wait, you know, it's just, it might still seem real harsh to somebody, but to me, it's coming a long way. And I'm talking to women now, but most of the women I come in contact with were waitresses, stupid, ignorant motherfuckers that can't even take an order and write down an order, right? And this is the mentality of the women. I was, I was never around business women. I was never around any woman that could think that had a fucking brain that had an idea. Now I have been around those kind of women and I have a lot of friends that are like that. Some of my old ladies are very high in my organization. They design album covers, they make logos, they run the video equipment. And it's, you know, it's a whole, and I'm realizing that there are, you know, there are women people, you know, it's like, once again, we go back to people. It's not, I don't say I, all women, I'm now, I say people, there's women. In general, I don't like most anybody, you know, but I like individuals. Right. But, but I don't say I hate all niggers, I hate all women, I hate all faggot, I hate all Jews, I hate all anything, Cubans, whatever, you know, it's just in general, I don't like people in general because I've been.

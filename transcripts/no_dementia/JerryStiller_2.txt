 I'm not feeling too good. I have to tell everybody, anybody's watching tonight, that I'm very upset by the fact that my son is not going to be on the show tonight. He's been making all the other shows. He did Letterman, he did the Charlie Rose, and he did the... All these shows, and Harry comes along and he disappoints you. And I want to tell you right now, as a member of the acting profession, I find this is a disgrace. I mean, I want to tell you right now, I want to apologize for my family. All the stillers, everybody was ever in this business. And my wife's family, that my son, let us all down like this. And I'm sick of him. And Father's Day or no Father's Day coming. Don't send me a card. Don't give me a try.

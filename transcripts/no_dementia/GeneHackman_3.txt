 Oh, well you know we've been doing this for about 12, 14 years and so I was actually still acting you know while I was writing. So it's been kind of a nice progression to kind of come over to the full time to the writing side. It's also very pleasant when you're writing to be able to sleep in your own bed and not be out on location somewhere working nights and in all kinds of weather and that kind of thing. So it's been a nice, a very nice idea for me and my older age.

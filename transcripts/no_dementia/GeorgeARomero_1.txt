 You know, it's funny, when I was in school, I never thought of making movies as a career. When I was growing up, I guess I'd always seemed like the people that made movies were elves that lived in magic land somewhere, you know, and on the planet of Hollywood. And I never thought seriously that a person could go and do that, you know, that was magic. And that was unachievable, unattainable. But I always wanted to play around with it. And I guess I always had played around with it. From the time I was a kid, played around with the medium. I got my hands on it, and I let me to movie cameras that my uncles had. And was always horsing around with it, idly. And when I first started here in Pittsburgh with friends of mine that were at Carnegie Mellon, we were all doing it idly. We were just playing around with something that we enjoyed doing. And I think none of us initially, we were really thinking seriously that we were starting to build a career or build a business out of it. And a couple of years later, we set up, in fact, the company to do commercials and industrial films, and like that, here in Pittsburgh. And because this is a big corporate market, we got some jobs. There were advertising agencies here, and it was kind of being in the right place at the right time. It was right when people stopped shooting live television commercials, you know, pouring beer between the innings of the ballgame, and like that. And film was, at that time, being used, just beginning to be used as a medium for creating.

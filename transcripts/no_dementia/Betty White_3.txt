 He finally talked me into it. It was scary, but it was the most fun I've ever had. It's a real experience because everything happens so fast and you can't memorize. And I can't use cue cards, but you have to there because you do maybe 40 sketches. You can't memorize them all because they keep changing. And then they grab you off one sketch into a closet. Somebody's taking your clothes off, somebody else is changing their wig and so on. And then they drag you out, back out on stage and you think, which sketch is this? What are we doing? Where are we? But it was really a wonderful experience. And as I say, I can't read cue cards, but there was this wonderful cue card man who said, just watch me. He said, don't look at Tina Fey, she's here. Look at me, I'm over her head. And he would hold the cards up way back and they would print it like this so I could read them. But she was doing the same over my head, but it looked like we were making eye contact. It's the only way you can handle that many sketches.

 I was the only child, I was lonely, and all those things, and millions of other kids were. But I wanted to compensate. I don't have any real theories about it. But I think a lot of it takes willpower. And those people I've observed are people who have tremendous willpower and a desperate, obsessive need to succeed. Olivia had this desperate need to succeed. All is life. He couldn't understand anything less than success. He couldn't understand anything less than perfection. It made him a troubled man, and I guess that a pattern goes through a lot of people, artists, actors, musicians, and business. They don't have to be artists. It's an obsession. A form of madness in a way. Madness is an easy way to use, and it's a dangerous way to use. But I suppose it's obsession. In my own case, I didn't want to ever... I didn't know what to do. I just wanted to do what I did with a passion. I started out, and I was very troubled and mixed up. And I believe that the thing for me was to keep my own constantly thinking, I don't want to let anyone know what I'm doing. I want to work quietly and creep up on people and make a life for myself. And there's a desperate need to make a life which seemed worth living for myself. How do I need it? I don't know, but a compensation. And I'm not obsessed in that sense anymore. But what I've done is worked so that I'm ready.

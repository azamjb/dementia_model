 Yeah, we hang out. I knew Gene first. He lived on town with his first wife. And he said this guy's coming back, Dustin, so he came back. And we tried to pick up girls. And Dusty still laughs about the stupidest line I ever saw. We just put down Nulalumonium in the apartment. And I said that the girl come after her apartment and see the Nulalumonium. And Dusty still laughs.

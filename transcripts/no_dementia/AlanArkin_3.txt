 They were wonderful. The whole thing just happened. Well, a lot of the things in my life that besides acting was the only thing I've ever done that I had to do and I had to do it in a certain way. And I've done a lot of other things and they were all accidents. They all just kind of happened. The tariers happened. It was something when I got out of college. It was just going to be a job that I did on weekends to earn some pocket money. And within a couple of months after joining the group, we had a hit record that took us around the world for a couple of years. And that was exciting until I got to the Olympia Theatre in Paris and I was planning a guitar and singing my brains on and looked down at myself with my black satin pants on and my sports shirt opened and the naval I said, what the hell am I doing? Oh my. I said I got to get back to acting and I quit the next day and starved for the couple of years.

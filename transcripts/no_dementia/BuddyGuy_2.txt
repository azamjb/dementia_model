 I remember Eric when we came out of Australia and you had a rock awards here in New York and we had Bo Dittlin, somebody asked him what was the blues. And he said, Mr. Donald Trump got the blues. I said to myself, wait a minute, he got to explain this. He said, yeah, he got the blues because he got to keep it and I got the blues because I got to get it. And that's been sticking with me ever since. And if you don't think you got the blues, just keep living. And if you don't think you get drunk, just keep drinking what you're drinking and thinking what you're thinking. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to play a little blues for you. All right.

 It's like the Ford car. I don't care how it have changed since 104 days, but it still got that Ford right across the front of the back of it there somewhere. When I first met Eric Clapton, face to face, he, I said, man, that record you made, strange, bruise, I said, that just goes all to my toes. He says, to your, that's your lick. I said, what do you mean, you listen to that thing you did with Junior Wells, that's why I got it from it. So, okay. But I didn't let that go to my head. He said, oh, Eric Clapton said, I did that. Now, I don't have to play that well, I'm a shoot man. I got, and then some of the kids will read it and say, I didn't know who he was until I read whatever Clapton said. And then I say to myself, oh shoot, I better go out here and show you I can hear a few leaks because of what Eric said. Don't mean nothing less. You can tell me you the best prize fighting the world. But if I don't see you not nobody out, you can improve it to me. So, that's where I look at my music.

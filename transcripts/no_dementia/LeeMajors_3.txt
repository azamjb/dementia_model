 It takes 12 people and follows them in there as they go through their lives. They're looking for something, yearning for something, trying to find something. And then it all intersects in the streets of Chicago, where they come to the resolution of whatever their problems were. Some were completely found and some of them were not. I mean, some were satisfied and some weren't. But anyway, it's just a powerful film. And I've seen a lot of faith-based movies, and I've done a few. Most of them may be considered a little vanilla. And this one has a production advantage of a big movie.

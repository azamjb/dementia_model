 Well, I hate to be accused of things that weren't entirely my idea. The chainsaw in Scarface, whereas from the Oliver Stone script was not my idea based on some research he had done in Florida in which there was a gang shootout and there were a lot of people chopped up with a chainsaw and dumped into trash bins. This was sort of a, to get the concept of the kind of brutality of the South American gangsters that are running cocaine back and forth. In Body Double, I'd always played with the idea of having a murder instrument that was electrical so that when you were going towards somebody the plug would pull out. I've been thinking about it since sisters really. The fact that they come one after the other makes one think that I'm getting into electrical hardware but that's not essentially true. It's also the fact that the Indian wants to be witnessed as a safe cracker so he has a drill there supposedly to open up to safe. That is not the murder instrument he's planning to use.

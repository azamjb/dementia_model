 Well, I would like to see some changes in the seniority system, but it's not going to make any difference from my saying this, but it's not because I'm furry and coming in. I think that the seniority system has many more drawbacks and that has merits, where I'm not going to lead me move to change that in my formative years in the Senate, but whether to be such a vote to come up, I clearly would vote to eliminate.

 But I'm very flattered that you would say that. That's nice to hear. You know, I know that you're from Dallas, and when we did Bonnie and Clyde, we worked in Dallas and Pilot Point, and a lot of little towns all around in a perimeter around Dallas. And I feel that in many ways, talking about acting, that that was kind of my perimeter for films, although I had done a few films before that, that Bonnie and Clyde was really kind of a breakthrough for me in terms of both acting and just plain acting and specifically for in films.

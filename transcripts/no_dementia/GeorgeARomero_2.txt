 Yeah, to some extent. I mean, yes. Initially we started to shoot it in black and white because it was cheaper. And then when all of a sudden when we got some investors, we said, well we could switch to color. The deal was we could switch to 16 millimeter color, or we could stick with 35 millimeter black and white. And I decided to stick with it because, I don't know, in my mind, my mind black and white, you know, the news was black and white. I don't know what a front was in black and white, you know. Blood looked better to me in black and white.
